# The maze is represented as a list of strings where each string contains
# characters such as walls (denoted by pound signs) and the starting and ending
# points of the maze. The goal is to navigate from the start to the end while
# avoiding walls

# Bases Cases:
# - If the spot is a wall
# - If the spot is off the maze
# - If the end was found
# - If the spot has already been traversed

# The algorithm begins at a point (like x0) and attempts to move in different
# directions (up, right, down, left). If it hits a wall or revisits a position,
# it backtracks by removing the current position from the stack and tries another
# direction. This process continues recursively, marking each visited position as
# "true" in a seen array. When a dead-end is encountered, the algorithm pops
# the current position off the stack and returns to the previous position,
# checking other directions until it either finds the exit or exhausts all possible
# paths. The order in which the directions are explored doesnâ€™t impact performance
# significantly, as the algorithm will eventually explore all paths. The time
# complexity is linear, O(N), because each square in the maze is checked up to
# four times, corresponding to the four possible directions, where N is the total
# number of squares
